Act out of the box
==================

This repository is meant to be a Vagrant build script!

please install Vagrant first

then:

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh


once connected:

    /vagrant/install.sh


Enjoy the ride!!

at this moment PostFix needs manual configuration:
    
    [ Local Only ]
    
    mongueurs.local
  


this is a NOT FULLY TESTED set-up to install

* Apache 1.2.42
* Mod_Perl 1.31

* Dependencies for Act

And it will look for a repository to install Act itself

Thanks to Alex Muntada for doing a lot of ground work.
His version actually also set up some additional software which I rather see as a two step process
